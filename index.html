      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I’m Brooke Brackett, a front‑end developer and systems‑minded problem solver with a
        strong foundation in modern web development, UI/UX principles, and digital
        marketing. I recently graduated from Cleveland Community College with an Associate
        in Applied Science in Programming & Web Development (AAS), earning <strong>Summa
        Cum Laude honors</strong> and maintaining a <strong>4.0 GPA across all
        coursework during my time there</strong>. Alongside my degree, I completed five specialized Information
        Technology certificates — each with a perfect <strong>4.0 GPA</strong> — including
        Web Development, Webmaster, Social Media, Computer Science Foundations, and IT
        Foundations. I also maintained President’s List academic standing throughout my
        program, reflecting consistency, discipline, and a deep commitment to mastering my
        craft.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>
        My technical background spans HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, WordPress
        development, SEO strategy, content creation, and social media optimization. During
        my five‑month internship with Epitome Digital Marketing, I worked on real client
        projects involving website development, SEO implementation, email and SMS nurture
        sequences, social media content creation, and lead‑magnet PDF design. This
        experience strengthened my ability to build user‑focused digital experiences that
        balance clean design, accessibility, and measurable marketing impact.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>
        I am also fully Git‑capable and manage my own repositories using Git and GitHub. I
        commit in clean, meaningful steps, maintain organized project histories, and use
        version control as part of my everyday workflow. This includes branching, merging,
        syncing changes, and managing multiple repositories for both personal and
        professional projects.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>
        Outside of professional work, I enjoy building personal projects that explore new
        tools and technologies. One of my favorite hobby projects is a directory‑style
        website that helps users discover and understand AI tools — a space where I combine
        research, writing, and front‑end development to create clear, helpful resources.
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <p>
        I’m especially passionate about AI, automation, and the future of intelligent
        digital experiences. I thrive in roles that allow for deep work, problem‑solving,
        and building meaningful systems and workflows that increase efficiency behind the scenes. I am firm believer that new technology tools and systems 
        will not replace people but will instead augment human creativity and productivity, allowing us to focus on higher-level thinking and innovation.
